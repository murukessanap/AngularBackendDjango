# AngularBackendDjango
i darts first model with angularJS linking demo

only jsonGet app is working here in this project. Its launched with "http://collobsearchmuru.pythonanywhere.com/jsonGet/" this url and it returns an array of jsons, when linked with 
angularJs html file uploaded here named "test2.html", it gets synced with remote website and updates the table dynamically. use CORS extension in chrome to make it work. For localhost html access to remote site 
is prohibited by chrome without this extension enabled..
